# Maintaining External State

This section covers the **state.rs** module which will hold the types that
we will be using to maintain non-GTK external state across the GTK UI. This
will honestly be incredibly simple and short, because this iteration of the
Markdown editor does not have much state to be concerned about.

## Planning What We Need

There are two key components that we need to be aware of throughout the
lifetime of this application: the **file path** of the currently-active
file that we are editing, and a **hash sum** of the file's contents to compare
with the content of the current editor in order to know when we should
disable/enable the save button.

## ActiveMetadata

And so, the **ActiveMetadata** structure was born. It contains a **PathBuf**
for storing the path of the active file, and a 64-byte hash sum that will
be generated by **keccak512()** from the
[tiny-keccak](https://docs.rs/tiny-keccak/1.4.0/tiny_keccak/fn.keccak512.html)
crate.

```rust
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};
use tiny_keccak::keccak512;

pub struct ActiveMetadata {
    path: PathBuf,
    sum:  [u8; 64],
}
```

The **impl** for this type will be fairly simple. We simply need a way to
create a new active metadata, a means of getting a reference to the internal
path, a conditional check to determine if given data computes the same sum
as the internal sum, and a means of updating the internal sum for when we
save a file.

```rust
impl ActiveMetadata {
    pub fn new(path: PathBuf, data: &[u8]) -> ActiveMetadata {
        ActiveMetadata { path, sum: keccak512(data) }
    }

    pub fn get_path<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a Path { &self.path }

    pub fn get_dir(&self) -> Option<PathBuf> { self.path.parent().map(|p| p.to_path_buf()) }

    pub fn is_same_as(&self, data: &[u8]) -> bool { &keccak512(data)[..] == &self.sum[..] }

    pub fn set_sum(&mut self, data: &[u8]) { self.sum = keccak512(data); }
}
```
